ps1.php
This file will be linked after new client is submitted to the database, and clicking the link you will receive a download of <clientname>.ps1 script. Running this script will configure Hyper-V and start the installation, writing out a live log in the process so you can monitor the status of your installation. Once installation is finished it will let you know, and restart and reconfigure the VM.

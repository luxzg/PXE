# First guide

First guide is 90% done and waiting final reviews, test and publishing to this repo. It contains Hyper-V environment with Ubuntu based PXE server which does some magix allowing deployment of new Ubuntu VMs on Hyper-V in just a few steps. Open web page, enter details of your new (future) VM, submit this, download PowerShell script, and run it as admin. Wait a while and your Ubuntu VM will be provisioned (setup, configured, installed, rebooted, and set for further use).

Guide will contain PDF with step-by-step instructions and configuration examples, and PHP code of a web based management.

Please open an issue if you find mistakes or any piece of the instructions isn't clear or straightforward enough.

Cheers, and have fun!
